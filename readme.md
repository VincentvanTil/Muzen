Muzen is a webshop where artists can upload their art, and users can buy it. Artist can create profiles, get subscriptions and upload art.

This project was made by Charlie, Omid, Thimo & I (Vincent).

The things I developed for the webshop are:

Footer.
Homepage, photography, illustrations and 3D art pages.
Sort by filter and colours filter.
Admin product crud and admin user crud.
User can edit their own products (crud).
Gallery
User profiles
Getting data from the database to load products and user info.
